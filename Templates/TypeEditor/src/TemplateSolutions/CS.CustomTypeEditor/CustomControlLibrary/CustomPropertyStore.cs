    ///  meaningfull way when we are editing the value at design-time from within the property grid. That is the 
    ///  reason we need a dedidcated editor (CustomTypeEditor) deriving from <see cref="UITypeEditor"/> which does
    ///  that job.
    ///  Note for CodeDom serialization: Since this is a complex type, serializing a property of this type in the 
    ///  custom control won't procude the correct code in the InitializeComponent method. Therefore, we need a 
    ///  custom serializer. Since we cannot refer to the types directly, we need to refer to them as full qualified names
    ///  and pass them to the <see cref="DesignerSerializerAttribute"/> as strings. 
    ///  The custom CodeDom serializer should by default be placed in the same assembly as the custom control's designer.
